# Breadboard Power Supply Module 

A compact, dual-output breadboard power supply that delivers **regulated 5V and 3.3V** from a 12V DC input. Designed for electronics prototyping, embedded systems, and educational projects.

## Overview

This custom PCB module is designed to fit alongside a standard breadboard and provide clean, stable power rails via male headers and screw terminals. The module uses **LM7805** and **LM317** linear regulators, along with standard passive components, to output 5V and 3.3V from a single 12V barrel jack input.

Ideal for powering:
- Microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP32, etc.)
- Sensors and modules
- Digital/analog circuits
- Educational breadboard projects

## Getting Started

1. Connect a **12V DC adapter** to the barrel jack.
2. Toggle the switch to power on the board.
3. Use the screw terminals or headers to connect **3.3V and 5V** rails to your breadboard.
4. Observe the LED indicator for power status.

>  For currents approaching 1A, heatsinks are recommended on the regulators.
